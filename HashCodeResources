Some previous solutions:
Hashcode 2018

This looks like a good (if a little hard to follow) solution in Java to the 2018 problem:

And a python solution:

Good explanation of a Python solution to the Hash Code 2017 (videos/caches) problem here:

Looks like good solution but not too many comments/explanations

Data Structures and Problem Solving:

Excellent general site (Python and Java implementations). Lots here that also might be useful for IrlCPC (study) but I am including here under "Hash Code" as you can access these during the competition.
However it would be best if you could look through these first (split this task) focusing on the ones most likely to be useful or are more complex

Tutorials – look at dynamic programming and graph ones if you can –
